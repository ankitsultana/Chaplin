Hi! My name is <span class="highlight-span">Raj Nikhil Choul</span>!

> I am an analyst with exploratory and predictive data analytics experience.

I am a data guy, with about 4 years of experience in extracting, cleaning, modeling and reporting data. I completed my master's in Business Intelligence and Analytics and have been working at an internet company as a Promotions Analyst for the past 1 year in San Francisco.

I have been using python's libraries such as Pandas, numpy, and scikit learn to do the data analytics and Power BI from Microsoft to report the learnings from these and other ad-hoc analysis.
